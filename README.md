# Project overview

Vanguard, a leading investment management company, launched a digital experiment to test the impact of a new, more intuitive User Interface (UI) on client engagement. The goal was to determine if the enhanced UI, along with in-context prompts, would improve the online process and increase completion rates.

# Questions

Did the new UI lead to higher completion rates among users compared to the traditional online process?

# Dataset

- Client demographics
- Experiment roster
- Digital footprints

# Conclusions

- The difference between the two groups' completion rates is small and may not justify the implementation of the new UI without additional analysis or evidence.
- The observed improvement might not be practically or statistically significant, depending on other factors like sample size or variation within the data.

# Next steps

Conduct further testing in order to reach a better UX for users and improve completion rate significantly with the least possible errors.
